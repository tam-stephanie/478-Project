One of my favorite anime of all time!

I was one of those people who thought that FMA: Brotherhood is the second season of Fullmetal Alchemist (2003). FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.

It follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.

I could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wanted more episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments.

I found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)

And the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent. It's funny, action packed, mysterious heart wrenching and beautiful.

This is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.
