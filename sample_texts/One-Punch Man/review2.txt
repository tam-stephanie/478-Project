This series is one thing, one simple thing...

SPECTACULARLY OVERRATED.

Overall - this series has a lot of potential, a comedic parody of shouen anime. However, the execution of this series is very poor.

Story - There is little to no discernible story line it seems, and whatever is there is needless drawn out and fraught with cliche, that more or less parody shouen story-lines, but without providing any actual comedy. Basically turning into a shitty version of what they are trying to make fun of.

Art/Sound - Only redeeming element of this anime, the art style is fantastic and it comes with a very good audio quality, the voice acting is about average.

Characters - Characters in this series tend to come off as extremely bland, and boring. This is quite a shame since the design and back story's of these characters are very interesting. This combined with decent voice acting should provide a decent set of characters. However, it doesn't this time, and it is very disappointing.

In conclusion - This is a very disappointing series, fantastic art and sound combine with an awful story and lackluster characters make this series just disheartening and one of the most boring anime I have ever seen.
