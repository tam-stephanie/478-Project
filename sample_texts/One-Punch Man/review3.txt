One Punch Man is an anime dedicated for those, including myself, who value more on superb action animation-based quality while putting story-wise and characters on the least priority. Because they focus so much on its animation and art wise, it can lead to double-edge sword for some people. On one hand, great animation and art can rise more enjoyment while putting less effort on story and characters can dampen the level of enjoyment.

So in order not to be slightly betrayed by this, I recommend people to shift their mode of thinking from being too serious to become "why so serious". That is, you should not having put too much thinking on characters and story as it may erode your enjoyment, but the erosion rate on characters and story might be slower than erosion rate based on action animation variables because its animation is so good to be re-watched and there are no annoying characters traits.

FOr the story, it is just there for the sake of completeness or as a complementary element for its near-perfect animation quality.

Those people who score One Punch Man as below 8 might weight more on story as their anchoring on Death Note's story quality standard while people, including myself, who score 8 and above is biased by the animation alone, but more than enough to satisfy their fundamental needs when watching anime.
