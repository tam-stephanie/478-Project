#Project Proposal: Sentiment Analysis of Anime Reviews

##I. Introduction
Like most TV shows and movies, animes have numerous reviews from many people with different perspectives and preferences. As someone who watches anime on a relatively regular basis, I am always looking for “good” animes (i.e., animes with decent, or better, reviews). Unfortunately, that entails sifting through hundreds of reviews/recommendations for thousands of anime shows and watching one to two episodes in order to actually gauge my interest. Obviously, this takes a significant amount of time, which like most people, I do not have. Thus, my project for this course will assist me in picking out animes to watch, based on the overall attitude of the reviews provided.
More specifically, this project will use sentiment analysis of the anime reviews in order to determine if an anime has a good enough rating to be watched. Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze text and then determine the reviewer’s attitude as overall positive, overall negative, or overall neutral. In various studies that have used sentiment analysis on movie reviews, they have compared Naïve Bayesian (NB) networks and support vector machines (SVMs) to see which one is more accurate. Since anime reviews are similar and different in various aspects, I am choosing to also compare the two classifiers, to see which one better rates the animes.
